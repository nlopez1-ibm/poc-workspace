## notes on usage NLopez
## IBM Open Editor v3 now takes zapp.yaml files and some vsCode settings.json definitions to setup a user build
## I've added comments on this example to explain how it works 
##  
## First install zowe and ibm open editor extensions
## create a zowe profile for zosmf (VSI) and ssh
## add them as the default in settings.json:
##    "zopeneditor.zowe": { 			
##       "defaultCliProfile": "zosmf",			
##       "defaultSshCliProfile": "ssh"		 	
##    },
## 
##
## Add these required settings to settings.json - (dont have to pre-define the dir):
##  "zopeneditor.userbuild.userSettings": {
##     "dbbWorkspace": "/u/ibmuser/vsCode_workspace",
##     "dbbHlq": "IBMUSER.VSCODE",
##     "dbbLogDir": "/u/nlopez/vsCode_workspace/logs" 
##   }, 

## use the userSettings variable below
